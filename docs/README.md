# Get Started

**MythBusters JS** is a JavaScript optimization handbook from a high level point of view, exploring the best practice and performance patterns but always keeping in mind the readability of your code.

The purpose of the book is write concise tips, easy to find and doing refresh your mindset about that for continuing working on your main coding problem.

Tips are grouped by topics and they have been obtained from engineering posts blog, podcasts, conference videos, etc. We keep all references in a specific section.

Performance depends on how people use programming the language. Something with a bad performance today could be better tomorrow.

In this sense, we updated tips reflecting new language features or rewritten tips based on internal V8 optimizations. We use [Six Speed](https://kpdecker.github.io/six-speed) and [Node Green](http://node.green) for tracking performance across Node.js versions.
